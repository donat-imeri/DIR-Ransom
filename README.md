# DIR-Ransom
 Directory Ransomware (DIR Ransom) is a ransomware build in Python for education purposes. It doesn't encrypt all files (can be easily extended to this point) but it encrypts just the files in the directory that you execute the ransomware.
 
 
# How to use DIR-Ransom
    
**Be careful:  All files you put in the Danger folder will be encrypted**
 1. Open Danger folder 
 2. Open Ransomware.pyw
 3. Now all files will get encrypted
 4. To decrypt them copy the ciphertext by clicking Copy cipher button
 5. Go to the main folder (DIR-Ransom) and open attacker.pyw
 6. Paste the ciphertext in the text field
 7. Click Decrypt
 8. A file with the name decrypted.txt will be created, open it and copy the key (password)
 9. Go back to the Ransomware.pyw window and paste the password
 10. Click Decrypt and your files will be decrypted
